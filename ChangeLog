Redirection.c

Old:
                ft_redirect
                    |
redirection_gt()        redirection_lt()

ft_redirect is called from new.c and it then figures out which redirection is needs to execute.
The "gt" stands for greater than and "lt" stands for less than.
I changed the function name to ft_redirect_backup.




New:

                ft_redirect
                    |
redirect_stdin()        redirect_stdout()

The section in the old structure got switched up a bit. We now have redirect_stdin which will redirect
the standard in. You just got to feed it the file descriptor to want to redirect. This makes it easier
to either iteratively do redirections or even recursively (for those situations where there's more than
one redirection in a command). Supporting functions are in redirect_support.c

redirection_support.c has a function that tokenizes redirections. Similar to how the c function strok works
but saves the command and redirection in 2 separate variables.
